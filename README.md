# Hi there 👋🏻

I'm a software developer with a keen interest for the creative arts. In my freetime I develop games, paint pictures, write stories, read books and play video games.

I'm currently working on
- [Breaking The Barrier](https://github.com/annamaria-szentpeteri/breaking-the-barrier-game) (a procedurally generated, short pixelart game) and
- Ex Terram: For All Mankind as part of [Chronoline Games](https://github.com/Chronoline-Games) (an RTS game)
